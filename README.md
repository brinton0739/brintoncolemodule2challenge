# brintoncolemodule2challenge
I have no other html training and we covered it really quickly in class so I had no idea where to even begin. 

Started by using html from module one to try and refresh the css and html training
copied as a start point, changed id's and anchors and relabeled the title and header to contact, work, about me, and resume

There are several commits just to make sure my work is saved
